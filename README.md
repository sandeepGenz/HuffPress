# **CompressoMaster: Efficient File Compression & Decompression**

Welcome to **CompressoMaster**, a powerful web tool for compressing and decompressing text files using the advanced Huffman Encoding algorithm. Whether you're looking to reduce file sizes or explore compression methods, **CompressoMaster** offers a seamless experience for users to efficiently handle their text files.

## Key Features

- **Huffman Compression**: Compress text files into smaller sizes using the highly efficient Huffman Encoding algorithm.
- **ZIP Packaging**: Both compressed files and frequency tables are neatly packaged into a downloadable ZIP file.
- **Decoding**: Decode compressed files and restore them to their original form with ease.
- **Compression Metrics**: Get insights into the compression process, including file size reduction, compression ratios, and encoding time.

## How It Works

1. **Compress Text Files**: Upload a text file to **CompressoMaster**, and the app will:
   - Generate a frequency table for the file content.
   - Build a Huffman tree and encode the file.
   - Save both the encoded file and the frequency table into a ZIP file for download.
   
2. **Decode Compressed Files**: Upload the compressed file along with its frequency table, and the app will:
   - Reconstruct the Huffman tree using the frequency table.
   - Decode the compressed content and display the original text.
